# Eslint and Prettier Setup

These are my settings for ESLint and Prettier

This package is based on the eslint package by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)

## What it does

- Lints JavaScript based on the latest standards
- Fixes issues and formatting errors with Prettier
- Lints + Fixes inside of html script tags
- Lints + Fixes React via eslint-config-airbnb
- You can see all the [rules here](https://github.com/rsturim0803/eslint-config-rsturim/blob/master/.eslintrc.js)

## Installing

### Local / Per Project Install

1. If you don't already have a `package.json` file, create one with `npm init`.

2. Then we need to install everything needed by the config:

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-rsturim
```

3. You can see in your package.json there are now a big list of devDependencies.

4. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project's directory (it should live where package.json does).

```
touch .eslintrc
```

Add this to your `.eslintrc`

```json
{
  "extends": ["rsturim"]
}
```

5. You can add two scripts to your `package.json` to lint and/or fix:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
},
```

6. Now you can manually lint your code by running `npm run lint` and fix all fixable issues with `npm run lint:fix`. You probably want your editor to do this though.

### Global Install

1. First install everything needed:

```
npx install-peerdeps --global eslint-config-rsturim
```

(**note:** npx is not a spelling mistake of **npm**. `npx` comes with when `node` and `npm` are installed and makes script running easier ðŸ˜ƒ)

2. Then you need to make a global `.eslintrc` file:

ESLint will look for one in your home directory

- `~/.eslintrc` for mac
- `C:\Users\username\.eslintrc` for windows

In your `.eslintrc` file, it should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": ["rsturim"]
}
```

3. To use from the CLI, you can now run `eslint .` or configure your editor as we show next.

## Settings

If you'd like to overwrite eslint or prettier settings, you can add the rules in your `.eslintrc` file. The [ESLint rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) go directly under `"rules"` while [prettier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) go under `"prettier/prettier"`. Note that prettier rules overwrite anything in my config (trailing comma, and single quote), so you'll need to include those as well.

```js
{
  "extends": [
    "rsturim"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": 2,
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "error",
      {
        "trailingComma": "es5",
        "singleQuote": true,
        "printWidth": 120,
        "tabWidth": 8,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## With VS Code

You should read this entire thing. Serious!

Once you have done one, or both, of the above installs. You probably want your editor to lint and fix for you. Here are the instructions for VS Code:

1. Install the [ESLint package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. Now we need to setup some VS Code settings via `Code/File` â†’ `Preferences` â†’ `Settings`. It's easier to enter these settings while editing the `settings.json` file, so click the `{}` icon in the top right corner:

```js
  // These are all my auto-save configs
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
// turn it off for JS and JSX, we will do this via eslint
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
// tell the ESLint plugin to run on save
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
// Optional BUT IMPORTANT: If you have the prettier extension enabled for other languages like CSS and HTML, turn it off for JS since we are doing it through Eslint already
"prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
```

## With Create React App

1. You gotta eject first `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`
1. Run `npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-rsturim`
1. Crack open your `package.json` and replace `"extends": "react-app"` with `"extends": "rsturim"`

## IT'S NOT WORKING

This will remove them all:

Remove local install

```
npm remove eslint-config-rsturim babel-eslint eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-html eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

Remove global install

```
npm remove --global eslint-config-rsturim babel-eslint eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-html eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

Then if you are using a local install, remove your `package-lock.json` file and delete the `node_modules/` directory.

Then follow the above instructions again.
